# What is this?

A mod that adds icelandic as a localization option to Outer Wilds

## Why?

* You're learning icelandic. More resources good!
* Simply have an interest in the language
* Þú ert íslendingur og vilt spila leiki á íslensku


## Screenshots

## Known bugs / issues
* Very greedy regex replacement has destroyed 3 keys and left in weird capiTaliZations in around 10-20 values. I've fixed this but have yet to create a new release. Will do that soon.
* Although I've compared the text with BÍN, there is a possibility that wrong permutations are still in there (f.x hafða vs hafðu). Feel free to repoert them or raise issues/suggestions here. I'm happy to receive constructive criticism.
* Þ is missing from title fonts. Looking into a fix when I have the time.
